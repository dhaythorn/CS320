How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I think the Unit testing I learned in this class is a good start. Ensuring that code works is the very first step. Bad isn't funcitonal or secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The different aspects of the Software Development Lifecycle that I've been working on in the last few courses are what I would use when helping customers meet their needs.

How do I approach designing software?
Although i've never made software before, I would approach it by getting a small piece of it running perfectly. Then I would make small incremental additions to it.
